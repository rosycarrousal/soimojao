If you've ever tried to download Vegas or AE plugins you know that it's a pain in the ass. Torrents are almost non-existent and there are tons of fake links or rar's with passwords everywhere. Then I found this Google Doc and it's a godsent https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGGIMad6AIl6DiFukDZCyqgnhKKCOArCfIlMYLtXey8/ (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGGIMad6AIl6DiFukDZCyqgnhKKCOArCfIlMYLtXey8/) It has all the big ones like Magic Bullet Looks; New BlueFX; Red Giant Optical Flare. Hi! :) I know, the Title is a bit confusing but let me explain! I'm not looking for the actual Pokemon Font or Pokemon Text Boxes/Bubbles (I already have those) I was just wondering if there is a way to make the Text/Characters to drop down kind of like on the Pokemon games if you know what I mean. I know how to add Text Animations but there aren't many options and I don't know where to Download more Text Animations for Sony Vegas Pro 15. I've downloaded Transitions/Effects like Magic. This question gets asked a lot, and for good reason. There are many different methods that YouTubers use to amplify growth, and whether they work or not varies from person to person. Rather than continuously asking this same question across multiple threads, I thought it would be helpful if we compiled all of the methods we use (within reason) inside this thread. Submit your techniques below and I'll periodically update this thread with them. I'll start with mine. 1. If you're a smaller chann. Hey r/VideoEditing, I make motion manga videos as a hobby and I've started having a rendering issue lately. As can be seen in this video link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AOHATHdXHsampfeature=youtu.be), whenever I render manga scans a really ugly flashing pattern along with flickering grain develop when I render it out. The issue is most noticeable when watched in 1080p (and especially noticeable in the bottom right corner). This has been a consistent issue across Vegas Pro 14, After.

Here is a cookies list I've compiled that might help you if you don't know what websites to visit or what products to check out. It has helped me tremendously in getting more ads.

My personal project still in need of more funding x_x --- I am a multimedia student and hobbyist. Multimedia tends to be a pretty pricey thing in the world (especially audio stuff), so I figured i would throw it out there for cheap for anyone who needs it. Because of this, I always try to do requested work within one's budget!! ##Absolutely no NSFW/Sexual content as well as Inappropriate content such as racist themes. Payment will be through Paypal only! So i've been having a problem with magic bullet looks in svp14 for quite som while now, but i recently found out how to make it work again. All i had to to to make it work was to go to user/programfiles/VEGAS and right-click the exe program vegas140 and click "run with integrated graphics". The problem is that i don't want to do this every time i use sony vegas, i just want to be able to click on it, and it will run with integrated graphics all by itself. Anyone who knows a few people are mentioning that they're getting bored, usually they happen to just be using stock sony vegas or premier. look into learning other stuff like after effects and good plugins for the programs you already use like sapphire, rsmb, magic bullet looks they'll improve the quality of your videos and will likely make you more interested in editing. 
Hey guys just wanted your thougths about something I recorded with the osmo+. honestly it looks weird.I don't know, maybe it's my rendering settings? I am using a magic bullet LUT and rendering 4k 30p footage at that same resolution in sony vegas pro 13. Any suggestions apreciated, maybe this is just the osmo's performance, but i really think I am missing a lot of color with this camera. https://youtu.be/AEkkz9lVymQ. Hey, so ive been trying to get a nice crisp video for about 3 hours, and the results arnt bad but theyre not crisp and clean like I want them to be, I have an a7s II and just feel like the quality is being ruined because of my export settings, ive had a look at videos from other people with the same camera and I cant seem to get my footage to render as nicely? Ive tried premiere and sony vegas, but my footage looks kinda. muddy? Im not sure how else to explain it, just doesnt look crisp. Anybody know how to get Color correction similiar to the one used in this music video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GIi2wefTwM like a nice warm cc I guess. I use sony vegas with magic bullet looks if that helps! thanks in advance everyone. Hey r/editors, I decided to come up with a list of software for essentially anything post.
