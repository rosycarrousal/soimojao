Hi folks (cake day today!!!!) I have an old sony vaio NS21Z/S which I still use as my daily machine ( programming and photoshop) I have upgraded the old disk with an SSD and the old fellow copes just fine. Currently it has an intel core 2 duo P8600 (2.4GHz, 1066MHz FSB,25W) running on Intel PM45 chipset. I was given a core 2 quad Q9100 ( 2.26GHz, 1066MHz FSB,45W) and of course I tried to upgrade. Unfortunately the laptop wont boot with the quad core ( the green leds lights up but nothing. Intel chipset products provide extreme power and performance for consumers, enthusiasts, or the enterprise with enhanced audio and video capabilities. Last year I bought a new laptop in the hopes that I would simply be able to play DODS and CSS after being without a decent computer for several years. After seeing that this laptop could really handle newer games, I started purchasing more through Steam and less for my consoles. I bought a lovely amount during Steam's holiday sale last year (though like many have yet to play most of them) and took a leap of faith this past summer when I preordered Deus Ex: Human Revolution The Intel El Paso board, made for Gateway by Intel has an 845 chipset, so it is limited to Socket 478 CPUs with a 400MHz front-side bus. IIRC, the fastest Pentium 4 with 400MHz FSB clocks at 2.4GHz. It's a Lenovo Y530 laptop with Windows 7, and I'm hoping to use it to stream iTunes music from my Mac, play Netflix instant and DVD's, and of course, browse reddit. Any ideas would be awesome.

Intel vPro technology is an umbrella marketing term used by Intel for a large collection of computer hardware technologies, including Hyperthreading, Turbo Boost 3.0, VT-x, VT-d, Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), and Intel Active Management Technology (AMT). Please help me isolate the cause of this issue even further. I've been dealing with this for over a year now and I still can't find a solution. Symptom: I hear clicks and pops on the NI Komplete Audio 6 USB audio interface when trying to stream audio through (main / headphone) outputs 1 amp 2 using Ableton Live 8.2 A little bit of history: When I finally got the money to buy a new audio interface (about 2 years ago), I went straight away to buy the RME Fireface 400. Luckily it was second. 
Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) is hardware-based technology built into PCs with Intel vPro technology.AMT is designed to help sys-admins remotely manage and secure PCs out-of-band when PC power is off, the operating system (OS) is unavailable (hung, crashed, corrupted, missing), software management agents are missing, or hardware (such as a hard disk drive or memory) has failed. Hey, I've got a Sager NP8660 laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo T9600, Intel PM45 chipset) that I just bought an ssd for, the ocz agility 3. I've got a weird problem and I have no idea how to go about solving it. Anytime I power down the laptop (be it hibernate standby or shutdown) twice, the third time I turn it on the ssd isn't recognized anymore. It doesn't even show up in the BIOS after that. I found a temporary fix in which I take out the drive and place it in an enclosure Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 (Socket P) chipset compatibility. A list of chipsets, compatible with the Core 2 Duo P8400 (Socket P), was compiled from CPU support lists, published on our website.

Trying to move a video card from one old broken laptop to another old laptop, so that I can use the destination laptop for college (I'm poor). Is there a website that will tell me if they are compatible? I've been Googling for an hour trying to find out. The video card is: GeForce 9800M GS 512MB Destination laptop is: HP Compaq ProBook 4510s (DDR3 Intel PM45/GM45 chipsets) The only graphics in it currently is integrated I found this info on the video card: Bus Support PCI-E 2.0 Supported.

Google hasn't been helpful. My chipset is an Intel PM45. I would like to be pointed in the right direction to figure out what SATA revision I have regardless of what chipset I have right now. What's the best way to find this out? Is there a good utility I can use that can spit out these type of specs.

Hello Reddit, Recently, I have decided to sell my custom built laptop as I am planning on upgrading to something a bit more powerful. I've been hoping to sell my current one, but I have no idea on what it is actually worth. I hope some of you will be able to give me a ballpark number, or any advice on how to go about selling it. I am currently living in Edinburgh, Scotland, so if you can write prices in GB Pounds, that would be fantastic. Laptop Specs: Type: Sony Vaio Motherboard: Chipset=.

I found an item online and asked the seller if it would be compatible to my laptop model but she only gave me this description and i do not know what it is: "Suitable for computers, laptops, Industrial PC or HTPC that with for Intel 945/ 965/ PM45/ GM45/ HM61/ 65 mainboard." And I would like to know how to find out of it is compatible. Laptop: HP dv6t-7200 Adapter size: 20x30mm. I am faced with an unfortunate situation in which my notebook, a Lenovo T60 (uses DDR2 RAM), which has an INTEL 945GM chipset, the motherboard is suspected to be faulty and probably has to be replaced. However, it is difficult to get the right one, and perhaps, uneconomical, given its age. By chance, I have a spare notebook, a Fujitsu Lifebook S6520, which screen is cracked. It has an INTEL GM45 or PM45 chipset, using DDR3 RAM Is it possible to transplant the good motherboard (/solved) Hey r/techsupport. I'm planning on upgrading my laptop's system memory as far as it'll go, to give it a bit more life and a bit more performance. Here's the exact model tech specs ( (scroll down to about 80% down.) Unfortunately, my machine is Korean About two years ago I bought a Dell Studio 1555. A few months ago after lots of power problems it finally gave out and can no longer be turned on (I was told that it's probably a motherboard problem). I need to access the hard drive to get my Windows 7 CD key. I don't quite know what's relevant but the laptop chipset was an Intel GM45/PM45/ICH9M. My new Mobo is a Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3 ATX LGA1155 Motherboard. Can I disassemble the laptop to access the hard drive 
My Acer 8935G laptop is running a duel graphics card setup (AMD Mobility HD4670 and Intel) and has started crashing constantly to a state where it's cycling though solid colors when I'm running it on the regular AMD card. It happens completely randomly when I'm for example running games or using the mouse scroll wheel and I've tried everything, including reinstalling Windows and changing external hardware/ports and so on and nothing makes any difference. Sometimes it's crashing every two minute. Here's what I can give you: OS: Windows 7 Home Premium RAM: 4 GB Video: GT240m Chipset: PM45 CPU: Intel Core 2 duo 2.20 ghz Atheros 8731 Ethernet Lan Controller Intel 5100 wireless Well I switched in msconfig boot options 1 cpu to 2. Then it wont boot WIndowa. Somehow later it booted and since then a code 10 error with both devices. Tried rebooting. Tried unistalling device with all driver traces includng in registry and reinstalling. and also in safe mode. Tried updating drivers nothing.
