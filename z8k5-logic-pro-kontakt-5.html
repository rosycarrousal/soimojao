This article explains how to route audio from each Instrument loaded in KONTAKT's Rack to separate channels in the Logic Mixer. Right now, Kontakt is on sale and there is a trick using Sennheiser's free Drummic'a software to get a 50% off cross grade deal. This brings the price down to 5 USD (while their June sale lasts). That's pretty good, but I'm still unsure about buying it. I have tons of plug-ins, thus wouldn't have much use for Komplete either, apart from some of the Kontakt libraries it comes bundled with. So, is Kontakt worth investing in? I use Logic and sometimes like to have some strings and pianos. I've recently installed Komplete 10 and have since updated it, and all the plug-ins are showing in Logic pro 9 except for Kontakt 5. If I open Logic in 32 bit mode, close it, then re-enable 64 bit, it rescans all of the plugins, and Kontakt will be there for the session. However, when I reopen Logic, it's not there, although massive, absynth, etc, are. What's going on? Edit: Fixed it, turns out the shortcut I had set up for Logic was 32 bit for some reason?

A tutorial on using Kontakt as a multi-timbral instrument in Logic. If you haven't set your kontakt up for multi-outs, please watch this video before I am trying to use Kontakt 5 (Free Version) to its highest capacity through Logic. I have the most updated versions of both softwares (updated today) and I notice that my sample libraries lag often when played through the DAW. I run my libraries (Spitfire Audio) through an external drive. Could this be the issue? I have done this for a long time, but there is a lot I don't know. I would really appreciate if someone who does this very often could give me a process to follow and maybe some trouble. 
Hey guys, Just picked up Kontakt 5 and having some trouble. When I boot up the Kontakt 5 standalone and load up my instrument I get sounds no problem.

Hi, I have been using Kontakt 5 with logic for a long time. But recently I encountered a slow start up issue. By that I mean when I open kontakt in logic pro, it takes awhile for it to open.

Hi, I'm playing around with some of the drum kits in Kontakt and I noticed that there are built-in drum loops. One of them really caught my ear and I'd like to record it in Logic Pro X, however these drum loops are played when I play a note above the 'active' range of the software instrument (drum kit/machine), whereas the active range plays the normal kicks/snares/cymbals/etc. When I try to record the loop, I can hear it and see the audio registering on the track, but it only records Get Kontakt by Native Instruments and learn how to use the plugin with Ableton Live, Logic, GarageBand, and FL Studio 
This is a problem I have only had with one other sample library and wasn't able to solve, but I wanted to see if anyone understood what causes this and how to fix it. Whenever I use the NI New York Concert Grand sample library and there is a MIDI note on beat one and the playback header (whether cycling or not) starts on the same beat as that MIDI note, the note gets cut off immediately after sounding. If playback begins a beat before the first note of the piano is being triggered, it sounds. I recently started making videogame music digitally, mostly orchestral and acoustic. My first few pieces were made using free VSTs from around the web, but I started to become frustrated by the low quality of most of my instrument samples, and I decided to upgrade. However, I was working on a tight budget, so I couldn't afford to spend £300+ on a full general-purpose library from Native Instruments, EastWest, etc. It turned out that finding a full sampled instrument library in the lt£200.

So, I am trying to figure out what the best sampler to use for a large number of drum kit files I've accumulated over the years. I have found that Ultrabeat and EXS24 have some pros and cons to using them. I was interested in other user's experience with any third party plugins (paid or free) that I might be able to use as an alternative to the native Logic plugins. Does anyone use the free Kontakt sampler? Would the paid Kontakt sampler be useful for drum kits, or would it basically offer.

I’m currently running Logic Pro and use Cinematic Strings for Kontakt. I’m finding some limitations in terms of expression and vibrato.
