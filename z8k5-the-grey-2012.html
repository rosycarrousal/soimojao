I got the general feeling from the other people in the movie theater that it was a disappointment for them. I think they expected a happy ending and more action throughout the movie. I even got a few comments that the movie's plot was "slow to unfold" which I didn't find to be the case at all. I was constantly searching for the next screen or next attack footage like it was a horror movie. I thought it was a poetic story. 
"The Grey" is an unrelenting demonstration that wolves have no opinion. When they attack, it's not personal. They've spent untold millennia learning how to survive, naked and without weapons, in fearsome places like the Arctic Circle in the dead of winter. They aren't precisely. After narrowly surviving a deadly plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness, a band of oil riggers must fend for their lives in the ice and snow. But thanks to wolves that view their presence as a threat, they aren't alone. THE GREY Trailer 2012 - official movie teaser trailer - starring Liam Neeson In Alaska, an oil drilling team struggle to survive after a plane crash strands. The Grey: An oil drilling team struggles to survive after a plane crash strands them in the wilds of Alaska. Hunting them is a pack of wolves So this kind of blew me away. It absolutely was not the film I was expecting based on the trailer. It was harrowing and extremely moving at times, with some really surprisingly quiet scenes. Liam Neeson knocked it out of the park and at times seemed to be channelling his own personal loss into a heartbreakingly raw performance. Hard to watch, but brilliant. Following a grueling five-week shift at an Alaskan oil refinery, workers led by sharpshooter John Ottway (Liam Neeson) are flying home for a much-needed vacation. A brutal storm causes their plane to crash in the frozen wilderness, and only eight men (Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney), including. Wow. I was really blown away by the ending. I really didn't expect it to be anything like this. I can't be the only one that would give this movie a 10/10. What are your thoughts? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1601913/. Financial analysis of The Grey (2012) including budget, domestic and international box office gross, DVD and Blu-ray sales reports, total earnings and profitability. The scene after the plane crash where he tells the man he is going to die. wow. Unfortunately that was about all that impressed me. The rest of the movie seemed so horrifically unrealistic. Surviving a plane crash? Okay that can happen. Wolves popping out one at a time?. doesn't seem likely. Wolves somehow teleporting to the bottom of a 100 foot drop off a canyon to nomnomnom the guy who fell off the rope? Wtf. Swimming in a freezing river for several minutes, getting. 
Ridley Scott, Joe Carnahan, Jules Daly, Mickey Liddell. Screenwriter. Joe Carnahan, Ian Jeffers. Final portion of the big update. Sorry, haha. The Grey - 5/10 Personally, I did not really notice nor care for what I did notice when it came to the "philosophical" element of this one. Truth be told, it felt like they were reaching to try and make what is a pretty typical survival drama hit home and be more profound than it truly is. Any claims to the contrary can be supported because, well, it's a survival drama. I see some reviews commenting on how this one is a study There were rumours that the film was going to be re-released in a limited run to remind the academy that this film exists, so hopefully it happens as I feel that it was really the surprise hit of the year for me, in my opinion.

The build up to the ending of The Grey was epic in my mind. From "Liam" having thoughts and short acts of suicide, moving from his flashbacks of his wife's battle with sickness, the last survivors of the plane fighting to survive, and the alpha's showdown = EPIC. The soundtrack was masterful, acting textbook, and the screenplay left no holes. The more I think of this movie the more I like it.if you have seen the film, thoughts.

I remember watching this on NETFLIX, it had an absolutely dreary atmosphere. It looked animated, but the eyes of the people looked real and too big for their faces, while their proportions looked human but exaggerated. The protagonist is this large nosed and depressed dude trudging through life until he. I can't remember if he works in the same facility as her or catches her on the train they ride together - but through her he gets wrapped up in this incredibly shady and dangerous cat-and-mo. The Grey is a thoughtful, tough-minded little tale of survival and attrition that sets its sights a bit further than its firepower takes.
